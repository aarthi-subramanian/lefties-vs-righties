# Lefties Vs. Righties

### Background
* A <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199104043241418">1991 study</a> alleged that left-handed humans (lefties) die, on average, <u>9 years</u> earlier than right-handed humans (righties). Oof!
* Here, we will leverage age distribution data to see if we can replicate this phenomenon on the basis of changing rates of left-handedness over time. 
* We will incorporate 2 datasets for our analysis: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/mortality_tables.htm"> 1999 US death distribution data</a>, and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1528408/">1992 rates of left-handedness</a>.
* We'll explore this data to plot the rates of left-handedness as a function of age, and try to understand the effect of changing handedness on the mean death age of lefties.

### Key skills
Pandas data cleaning and manipulation, bayesian probability and statistics, matplotlib data visualisation.
